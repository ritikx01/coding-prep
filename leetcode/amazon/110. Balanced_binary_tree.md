Question: Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
    a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def check(root):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            left, right = check(root.left), check(root.right)
            if left == -1 or right == -1 or abs(left - right) > 1:
                return -1
            return max(left, right) + 1

        return check(root) != -1
```
Explanation: This is a slight modification of height of a binary tree function. We keep finding height  
of the tree recursively, and if at any point the tree is unbalanced, we will start returning `-1`.
Finally, if inner function returns -1, the main function will return False.
