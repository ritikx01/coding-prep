Question: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.  
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if (p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        if (p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
```
Explanation: Only the lowest common ancestor will have p and q at alternate side of children, else both at left or both at right  
If both values are lower than root, LCA will be on the left of root.  
If both values are higher than root, LCA will be on the right of root.
