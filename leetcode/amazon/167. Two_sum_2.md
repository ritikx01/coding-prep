Question: Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.  
```python3
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        first = 0
        last = len(numbers)-1
        currsum = numbers[first] + numbers[last]
        while currsum != target:
            if currsum < target:
                first += 1
            else:
                last -= 1
            currsum = numbers[first] + numbers[last]
        return [first+1, last+1]
```
Explanation: We use two pointer strategy, one from start and one from end.
Add the numbers at indices of both pointers, if  
1. sum == target, return [first, last]
2. sum < target, increase first so as to increase the sum
3. sum > target, decrease last so as to decrease the sum
