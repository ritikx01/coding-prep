Question: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
```python3
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        L = 0
        max_profit = 0

        for i in range(len(prices)):

            if prices[i] < prices[L]:
                L = i
            else:
                max_profit = max(prices[i] - prices[L], max_profit)

        return max_profit
```
Explanation:  
1. Initialize max_profit to 0 and L (Buy pointer) at the start of the array(0).  
2. Now traverse the array, if the element is lower than current buying point, move L to that element index,
if the element is greater than buying point (that means profit), compute the profit and compare with current maximum profit.
