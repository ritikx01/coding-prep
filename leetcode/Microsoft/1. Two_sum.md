Question: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

```python3
def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    memo = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] in memo:
            return [memo[nums[i]], i]
        memo[target - nums[i]] = i

print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))
```
Explanation: Apart from bruteforce, we can solve this in O(N) time.  
We maintain a dictionary that has  
key = target - current number
value = index of current number
Then when iterating, if a number that shows up that is already present in the dict,  
we return value of that number from dict and index of current number.
