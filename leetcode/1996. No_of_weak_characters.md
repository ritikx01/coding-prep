Question: You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.
A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attackj > attacki and defensej > defensei.
Return the number of weak characters. 
```python3
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, properties: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        properties.sort(key= lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        weak = 0
        max = 0
        for _, d in properties:
            if d < max:
                weak += 1
            else:
                max = d
                
        return weak
```
Explanation: We need to return all the characters that are weak.
Sort the list in descending order using attack as key, if the attack is same sort them in ascending order.
Now all the elements are "potentially" weak than their previous elements.  
Traverse the list and keep track of the current max defence, if some character has defence less than that then it is weak.  
Increment the answer by one and return.
