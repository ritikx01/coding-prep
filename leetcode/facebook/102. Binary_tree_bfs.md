Question: Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).  
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        q = []
        q.append(root)

        while q:
            level = []
            for i in range(len(q)):
                current = q.pop(0)
                if current:
                    level.append(current.val)
                    q.append(current.left)
                    q.append(current.right)
            if level:
                res.append(level)
        return res

```
Explanation:  
res is for final result
q is a queue in which we add nodes in level order.  
  
Start by appending root to the queue, then iterate over it. current is the the first element of the queue to be removed.  
In levels append all the child.data of current and after for loop append it to the result.
