Question: Minimum number of coins required to make any denomination from 1 to N. Cumulative sum of coin should
not exceed N

```python3
def coins(num):
    five = (num - 4) // 5
    if (num - five * 5) % 2 == 0:
        one = 2
    else:
        one = 1
    two = (num - five * 5 - one) // 2
    return five, two, one

print(coins(13))
```
Explanation: 
No of 5 coins: (N - 4)//5 to find the multiple of 5 that is smaller than N and atleast 4 less than N. The remaining 4
or more will be formed using 1 and 2 coins.
